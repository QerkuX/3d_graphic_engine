What we start with:
1. file with polygons containing list of points that create their absolute position, color and normal

What we have to do:
1. transform position of each point to match players position (put player position at [0, 0, 0])
2. transform rotation of each point to match players rotation (put player rotation at [0, 0])
3. project polygon points to get rid of "Z" dimension
4. create polygons(triangles) out of the points (remember about the color)

5. add player movement
6. add simple shadows (normal based)
